                <p>“I love that Bandzoogle offers a very user-friendly platform.<br> It's custom made for any musician's needs.<br> As someone who doesn't have much experience building a website,<br> I found the process with Bandzoogle very straightforward.<br> It was easy to build a polished, good looking website within a day.”<br>

                <p>“I sometimes get the feeling that it's almost TOO good to be true.<br> It's the first website builder I've found to integrate so many features specific to a band's needs.<br> You can run a store, build a mailing list,<br> showcase music, and operate a subscription service all in one place. ”<br>
